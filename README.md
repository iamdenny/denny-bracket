# Denny Bracket

Production: https://bracket.iamdenny.com/en/

Knockout and round-robin tournaments, score entry, standings, advancement, print/export and local saved sessions. Undo/redo retains up to 40 changes during the visit; reload clears history. Unfinished-match filtering changes the view only, and progress excludes byes.

## Development

Node.js 24.22.1 (24.x), native ES modules, no runtime dependencies. Run `npm run verify` for tests, static build and SEO/link audits. Run `npm run dev` (default port 4350); set `PORT` to use another port. Generated output is `dist/`.

## Content and languages

The reviewed release contains **300 distinct activities** and **1220 indexable pages**. English starts at `/en/`; Korean, Japanese and Spanish use `/ko/`, `/ja/` and `/es/`. Translation variants are pages, not additional activities. Existing routes and IDs must be preserved. Historical expansion documents record earlier release counts.

## Privacy, analytics and revenue

`src/consent.js` provides one shared panel. The initial allow/reject actions save immediately; individual purpose controls and the save action appear only after customization. Advertising and analytics remain separate choices, shared across the six participating Denny services using an `iamdenny.com` cookie for up to 180 days.

GA4 is configured in `site.json` and loads only on the production hostname after analytics permission. Adsterra uses a site-specific unit after advertising permission and provider/configuration checks. Inputs, answers and URL query/fragment payloads are excluded from the curated analytics events. Coupang remains disabled by `coupang.channelRegistered: false`; verify persistent provider registration before enabling it.

Official promotion artwork occupies the top, bottom and desktop rails. On narrow screens the top banners become a horizontally scrollable row; focus mode hides surrounding promotions. Provider approval, ad category filtering, actual ad fill, GA receipt and revenue require separate evidence.

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` run `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: verify, upload `dist`, deploy GitHub Pages, then attempt IndexNow submission. Pull requests verify without deployment. DNS targets `iamdenny.github.io` with the service CNAME. Compare the public `/release.json` commit with the intended revision; a successful build alone is not deployment proof. See the operations guide for rollback and provider checks.
